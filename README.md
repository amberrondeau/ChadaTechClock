What did you do particularly well?
I think my drive to try to complete the code was done well

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
There is probably a lot to be fixed with this code, I never was able to submit my files corretly and stopped receiving feedback to improve.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The hardest part of coding for me overall is the little tweaks that need to be made to make the program operable, trying to find the issue sometimes can be frustrating but I found with time, breaks and Google, it is easier.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The best thing I learned from this project was overall taking the time to ensure everything is correct and follow through with the submission of my projects to ensure at least an understanding of the issues

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Still working on it
